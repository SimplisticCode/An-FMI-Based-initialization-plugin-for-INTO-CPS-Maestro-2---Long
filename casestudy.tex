\section{Case study}

%This paper's main contribution is to calculate an initialization order of a co-simulation scenario potentially containing algebraic loops. The approach make the circular dependencies between the interconnected converge in the initialization, so the initial values of the interconnected variables in the system being simulated is stable at the time the co-simulation is started.
