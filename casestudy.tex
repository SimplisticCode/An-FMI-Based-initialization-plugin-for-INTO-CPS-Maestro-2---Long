\section{Case study}

%This paper's main contribution is to calculate an initialization order of a co-simulation scenario potentially containing algebraic loops. The approach make the circular dependencies between the interconnected converge in the initialization, so the initial values of the interconnected variables in the system being simulated is stable at the time the co-simulation is started.

In this section, we give a simple example of a co-simulation whose correct initialization demands the solution to an algebraic loop.

In the example case study, the acceleration can be set to 0, at time 0.
We show that \verb|tire_x| depends on itself as a consequence:
\begin{verbatim}
0 = a = (1/tire_mass) * F_total
0 = F_total = F_rubber + F_suspension - f_gravity
f_gravity - F_suspension = F_rubber
F_rubber = - rubber_stiffness*tire_x - rubber_damping * tire_v
tire_v = 0
F_rubber = - rubber_stiffness*tire_x

F_suspension = suspension_stiffness*(car_x - tire_x) + suspension_damping*(car_v - tire_v);

tire_x = F(F_rubber) = G(F_suspension)= H(tire_x)
\end{verbatim}
