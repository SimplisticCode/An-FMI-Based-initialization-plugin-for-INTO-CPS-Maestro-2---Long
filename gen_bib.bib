In a master-slave concept the slaves simulate sub-problems whereas the master is responsible for both coordinating the overall simu- lation as well as transferring data. To unify the inter- face between master and slave the FMI for Co- Simulation was developed. Using FMI a master was implemented with simple and advanced algorithms which can be applied depending on the properties of the involved slave simulators. The master was tested amongst others by coupling with SimulationX.},

  abstract = {Modern device trends present greater challenges to design [1] because many of them integrate continuous and discrete sub-systems and therefore their design involves specific global modeling and validation approaches. This paper proposes the operational semantics for rollback-based synchronization model that may be used in continuous/discrete systems simulation. The paper also addresses the formal representation of the behavior of the continuous/discrete simulation interfaces with respect to this mode. This representation enables the definition of generic and language independent co-simulation tools that can be used to provide global simulation models for continuous/discrete heterogeneous systems. The model was validated through simulation, using UPPAAL toolbox and its formal verification was realized by defining and checking the main properties.},

  abstract = {The numerical stability and the convergence behavior of cosimulation methods are analyzed in this manuscript. We investigate explicit and implicit coupling schemes with different approximation orders and discuss three decomposition techniques, namely, force/force-, force/displacement-, and displacement/displacement-decomposition. Here, we only consider cosimulation methods where the coupling is realized by applied forces/torques, i.e., the case that the coupling between the subsystems is described by constitutive laws. Solver coupling with algebraic constraint equations is not investigated. For the stability analysis, a test model has to be defined. Following the stability definition for numerical time integration schemes (Dahlquist's stability theory), a linear test model is used. The cosimulation test model applied here is a two-mass oscillator, which may be interpreted as two Dahlquist equations coupled by a linear spring/damper system. Discretizing the test model with a cosimulation method, recurrence equations can be derived, which describe the time discrete cosimulation solution. The stability of the recurrence equations system represents the numerical stability of the cosimulation approach and can easily be determined by an eigenvalue analysis.},
