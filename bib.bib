  abstract = {Co-Simulation is a general approach to simulate coupled technical systems. In a master-slave concept the slaves simulate sub-problems whereas the master is responsible for both coordinating the overall simu- lation as well as transferring data. To unify the inter- face between master and slave the FMI for Co- Simulation was developed. Using FMI a master was implemented with simple and advanced algorithms which can be applied depending on the properties of the involved slave simulators. The master was tested amongst others by coupling with SimulationX.},
