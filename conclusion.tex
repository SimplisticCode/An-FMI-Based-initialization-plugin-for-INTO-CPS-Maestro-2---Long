\section{Concluding remarks}\label{sc:summary}
This work uses a topological ordering of a dependency graph of the interconnected FMUs variable and internal FMU variable connections along with predicates from the FMI specification to calculate a correct initialization order for a co-simulation scenario. 
\claudio{You forgot to mention algebraic loops.}
The plugin optimizes the calculated initialization order by grouping variables with similar characteristics to perform the fewest possible operations in the initialization procedure.
This approach supports the initialization of a co-simulation scenario containing algebraic loops by using fixed point iteration. 
%The approach discards all co-simulation scenarios, not adhering to the law of convergence defined in \cref{def:convergence}.
Our approach is suitable to combine with well-established master algorithms like Gauss-Seidel and Jacobi \cite{Palensky2017}. 
The approach is realized as a plugin for the open-source INTO-CPS Maestro 2 tool and verified against the existing \textit{Initializer} and the calculated initialization order was verified against an established co-simulation Algorithm Generator and Verifier implemented in Prolog\cite{gomes_lucio_vangheluwe_2019}\\
Future work includes formal verification of the plugin using the Logika framework\cite{inbook}.
We will also look into the generation of a verification strategy for the whole Maestro 2 framework to examine how different forms of verification jointly can extend the trust of the correctness of the result of a co-simulation.
